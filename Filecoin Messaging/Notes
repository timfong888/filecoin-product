## Notes

1. Customers want to be able to store things on IPFS;
2. Customers want an easy way to pay for pinning on IPFS;
3. Web3 customers prefer a decentralized IPFS, meaning the pinning infrastructure is not centralized;
4. Web3 customers (some) would like a way to have durability guarantees of cold-archived data;
5. Customers want to retrieve data from IPFS and have guarantees it's available;
6. Some dapps may want to have a "private" IPFS network for their users (ENS), meaning that they will pay for storage and retrieval of data for their users.
7. Data can be retrieved from any IPFS gateway.
8. Future:
    a. Data on IPFS will have ACL-policies determining access to stored data;

Today we are announcing IPFS-plus powered by Filecoin: decentralized pinning.
