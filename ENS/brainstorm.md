# Brainstorm

## Outline

1. 5 Customer Questions
2. Working Backwards Outline
3. FAQ - Customer
4. FAQ - Stakeholder

## Ideas to Explore
1. IPFS+ customers can have a sealed backup of their data that is stored in the content hash record (e.g. a blog)
2. We need a way to direct the subsidy to not just PoRep, but towards users of the services (more services, more payments, longer duration should lead to more of the subsidy);
    a) A User who pays for a bundle of retrieval, hot storage, and PoRep, benefits from some of the subsidy being directed to offset their fees as long as they continue to pay;


## What are the User Stories for ENS Customers?
As a User, I want to store my data in a way that:

1) Will not disappear as long as I am paying for the service
2) Will be immutable 
3) Will not miss assets when it loads
4) Will not exceed cost expectations
5) Will not be tampered or poisoned or censored
6) Will scale with concurrent readers
7) Will not be inaccessible due to a single point of failure

## What are the User Stories for ENS?
As the ENS service, I want:
1) To ensure all of my User'srequests are met
2) The price for the storage service is competitive and predictable
3) ENS has global control over the service parameters
4) Guarantees I am not overpaying

## What are the User Stories for the Filecoin Protocol?
As the Filecoin Protocol, I want:

1) To reward and incentivize long-term paying 
2) I want to issue rewards in a way that cannot be gamed
3) I want to incentivize bundled use of services
4) I want to offer an easy developer experience
5) I want to offer granular controls over the services
6) I want to make it easy to pay on-chain via smart contracts
