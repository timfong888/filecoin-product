Introduction

Meetings at Amazon often start by everyone silently reading a document (or 

narrative

) such as a proposal, project update, key data, or metrics for anywhere from ten to 30 minutes depending on the topic. While reading, people make notes and prepare for the discussion that will follow. No

projector is provided for a PowerPoint presentation. The copies of the documents you bring are the only material for the meeting. Bring some pens along to the meeting room in case your reviewers don't have a pen with them. Your narrative and supporting documents should be written so

that anyone without background is able to understand them. To achieve this in your writing, you will beneft from having people read your narrative and examine your arguments even before you present your documents to your fnal audience.

Guidelines for Conducting a Meeting

Who to invite

Whether reviewing a draft or fnal version of your narrative, consider who should be in your meeting before sending invitations. Ask yourself, "Who might have insights or helpful suggestions that can make the document stronger?" "Who has a keen interest in this topic or project?" Also invite

some people who know nothing about the topic when reading early drafts. All of these potential invitees might fnd some of your wording confusing, your reasoning unclear, or your logic ßawed, which is valuable feedback for refning your thinking. 

Also consider who else should be on board

before you present the narrative to your intended fnal audience. You might invite them to a draft review. As a rule you don't want anything in your narrative to be a surprise to your manager or stakeholders. The last thing you want to have happen in the fnal narrative presentation meeting is

for someone to say, "I know nothing about this and cannot support it."

"Back-pocket" preparation

Separate from the narrative's set of appendices, this is the "I-don't-think-we'll-go-there, but-just-in-case-we-do" fles that you bring with you to the meeting. For example, while you were writing your document, you may have articulated a point or a counterpoint more expansively than in the

fnal version to due to space constraints. Before going into the narrative review meeting (informal or fnal) be aware of what arguments might require further elaboration, and come prepared with additional information in your "back pocket." Bring fnancial analyses, technical data, customer

data, or other supporting materials that you may need to reference. The Leadership Principle "Dive Deep" sets an expectation that you will be able to provide additional data or background upon request; this illustrates your comprehensive understanding of the topic.

Schedule enough time for the meeting

It is your responsibility to ask for the appropriate amount of time to present and review your narrative. If you have a six-page narrative and have scheduled only 30 minutes, then you will not have enough time for everyone to read the narrative and ask questions. A rule of thumb is to spend 1/3

of the meeting reading, 1/3 addressing questions and comments in the doc, and 1/3 answering the questions and debating the recommendations. For one-o

!

, new topics, it takes many attendees two to four minutes to read a page so a two-pager with an additional two pages for the FAQ

and appendix will take 8-16 minutes to read and a six-pager with an additional six pages for the FAQ and appendix will take 24-48 minutes.

Run the meeting

Keep your introductory statements super brief.

 Everything you want to say should be in the frst section of the narrative so you don't have to say it. 

Examples:

"Our meeting today is about XÉ"

"Please read the document and then let's talk through Y and Z. The goal for today is to have a decision by the time we are done."

"This review is meant to be informative. Please read the narrative and then we'll move to Q&A." 

(Use this if you don't have a specifc decision to make.)

"It will also be important to discuss Y, but we'll do so in a separate meeting as our time today is limited." (Use this if an issue will likely surface that isn't relevant to address during meeting.)

Give your reviewers time to read.

 Distribute the printed copies of your narrative to the attendees. Let people start reading the document even if everyone has not arrived yet. Ask people to look up and give you "a nod" when they are fnished reading, and anyone on the phone to give an

indication when done. Don't talk while your reviewers are reading. Give people adequate time to read, up to 30 minutes for a typical six-page narrative with FAQs and other appendices. Those who have already read the document are free to read their email during this time. When you notice

that most people are done reading, let everyone know they have another 1-2 minutes to fnish. 

Note: you may send out the document in advance of the meeting, but don't expect that all (or anyone) will have read it before the meeting.

Begin the discussion.

 When the key reviewers are ready, go through the document by asking for feedback overall and then page by page or section by section. Be an active participant in the discussion while also capturing the questions asked, questions you can't answer, discussion points,

feedback, and suggestions from your reviewers. Be prepared to stop tangential and non-productive discussions to keep the review on track. You are the one responsible for guiding the meeting to ensure you achieve the goal of the review meeting.

Conclude the meeting.

 In the last few minutes, wrap up the meeting by summarizing, e.g., key takeaways, input received, decisions made, and next steps. Clearly state the owners and deadlines for any follow-up items. If appropriate, collect the printed documents at the end of the meeting.

Follow up afterwards. Send an email summarizing any follow-up items and thanking everyone for their participation in the review.

More Tips for Conducting the Meeting

Listen, Understand, then Answer, then Educate.

If you don't understand a question, ask for clarifcation.

If you don't know the answer to a question, say "I don't know. I'll get back to you by [date]." It is better to do that rather than answer inaccurately. Do not guess.

If the question is "who," then answer with a name.

If the question is "when," then answer with a date.

Give a crisp answer, and then stop. Don't go into excessive explanation or detail. Do not talk around the question or answer a di

!

erent question than asked.

If someone asks you the "wrong" question, answer the question and then state why you think it was the wrong question. Alter natively, state what else you think the person may be interested in knowing. Asking a clarifying question before answering is fne. If you start answering by

saying why you think their question was wrong and what it should have been, then you will sound defensive and not open to feedback.

Admit Mistakes.

 Do this freely during the review meeting. Making a mistake is fne; we are agile, we run lean, and mistakes will happen. What matters is that you lear n from a mistake and make a systemic change so that you do not make the same mistake again.

Take Criticism as an Opportunity to Lear n.

 Amazonians are passionate, and their feedback about your document can feel more personal than it is. Manage your inter nal defensiveness; stay curious. Do not respond by blaming someone else or saying that it's "somebody else's problem."

Stick to the facts and data. We are all continuously striving to improve and this is what motivates the criticism and feedback. Take thorough notes and try not to process everything during the meeting itself. Set your review notes aside for a day. Reread your notes the next day and analyze

them with a fresh mind.

When You are in a Hole, Stop Digging.

 If someone criticizes your thinking, consider what grain of truth is in the statement before you automatically defend yourself. If there is truth (no matter how small), then thank the person for the insight and move on. If you disagree with someone's

critique, speak up. However, think carefully about whether (or for how long) you want to defend yourself.

The Role of the Reader

As an attendee of the narrative review meeting, ask questions to the document presenter about concer ns you have about the content or ask clarifying questions. Before posing a question, ask yourself: What am I trying to achieve with this question? What is the endpoint? While reading, be

asking yourself these questions to help you frame your questions and o

!

er your feedback:

What is the key message?

What data is most insightful or relevant?

Is the writer making assumptions unsupported by data?

Is the story a compelling one?

Would I provide the writer with the resources requested? Why or why not?

How does the visual format work for me? Is there enough white space? Are the headings useful and logical?

Don't ask questions for the sake of asking questions. Refrain from pointing out grammar, spelling, or formatting mistakes Ð time is limited during the review; inform the presenter afterwards of these errors so that he/she can write a better document in the future.

Introduction

Writing great documents at Amazon is a skill that takes plenty of practice.  Over time you lear n what works and what doesn't.  No matter what the subject or who the author is, there are always some basic document Ômust-do's' that are worth following.  Outside of the obvious ones, like

spelling and grammar checks, the following points are worth noting.

Starting a new document

Purpose.

 In the opening paragraph, be explicit about who the intended audience is and the purpose of the document.  It should also try to distill the what, why, if, and how for the project.  *

IF

* asking the reader to do something (provide feedback, approval, guidance for next steps) be explicit

in the frst paragraph as to what you *

need from them

* ("

the purpose of this document is to seek your feedback on X

").

á         

what

 you want to do

á         

why

 we should be pursuing it (ideally driven by data and strategically thematic)

á         

if 

successful, what will Amazon get (CP, DS-CP, CCP, DS-OPS, OPS, Units, E%O, customer satisfaction, new customers, more active customers, new HVAs etc.)

á         

how

 do you plan to get there (what's the timeline, milestones, next steps)

Outline/FAQ.

 It can always be helpful to create an outline of the document before you start writing. What makes a document powerful and compelling is the linking between one concept and the next to come to a solid conclusion. Most people need an outline around which to form their

thoughts cohesively.  An outline will help you think more clearly about the ßow of the doc.  We also have a lot of project or business ideas that are presented to people who are not as well versed on all the strategic issues facing our group.  *

Remember

* you are educating most audiences at

the same time you are asking for approval. The outline will better help us think about the audience and the stage setting necessary.  Another approach rather than an outline is to start out with a FAQ.  Just start listing out the questions that need to be answered and then work them into a ßow

later. 

Planning/Review.

 If the document is going to Senior Management, please give yourself plenty of time for iterative review.  Agreeing on the outline upfront should help reduce the review time.  Get the senior management review date on the calendar ASAP, even if you haven't started writing the

document.  These reviews are often scheduled weeks out.  When you have the scheduled date, 

work backwards from that date

 and ensure you have plenty of document review check-ins.  Don't leave everything to the last minute!

Document writing etiquette

The main document should be combined prose and data, and a maximum of six pages long.  Some will be substantially shorter than that, which is OK (and encouraged if you don't have enough content to fll six pages).  Above the six page limit, appendices are fne.  Ideally appendices will

provide deeper dive information or tangential points, not key subject matter.

Always include Amazon Confdential, date, and page numbers in the header and footer.

If the topic relates to any legal issue, including risk analysis around sensitive topics, change ÔAmazon Confdential' to ÔAmazon Privileged and Confdential' in the footer.  Ensure a lawyer is in the Ôto' line when you email the document and mark the email ÔPrivileged and Confdential' in the

subject line of the email.  Never send a privileged 

document to anyone outside of Amazon without express direction from legal to do so, and do not send inside of Amazon unless you are certain that person has a need for, and the right to receive, the information. 

When reviewing the

document in a meeting or over the phone/VC, ensure that a lawyer is present.

Use black, Calibri, 11 point, single spacing.

Use double capital MMs to express millions, and one capital K for thousands.  E.g.  $10MM for 10 million dollars, and 90K for 90 thousand.

As a general rule, keep to one decimal point when expressing YoY or WoW growth.  E.g. 25.7% WoW growth (not 25.68%).

Present no more than 2 decimal points when expressing large numbers or E%O.  E.g. an E%O of 8.56% or OPS of $347.56MM.

Please make sure your sentences are clear on what the unit of measure is, and absolute number-- saying "we grew 40%" is not clear; saying "WW OPS was $45MM, up 40% YoY" is clear.

When writing numbers, always write the number up to and include ten (e.g. nine people not 9 people).  After ten use numbers (e.g. 13 people).

Print double-sided.

Spell check.

Be as concise and tight as possible.

Use plain English, don't use jargon/buzzwords.

Do not use acronyms or program names without defning them in advance.

Write in the Active Voice rather than the Passive Voice whenever possible.  An easy way to remember is to make sure the subject for your verbs is either "We" or "the team".   An example of Active Voice:  "Working with Google, we tested bidding the Amazon Keyword for two hours a day"

[good].   The Passive Voice would be expressed as "Bidding the Amazon Keyword was tested for two hours a day" [bad].

When appropriate, think about how your subject fts within a global business. For example, if a proposal is confned to a specifc geography or if di

!

erent locations require special considerations, address the inter national impact clearly.

Keep in mind that, despite our best e

!

orts, it's possible that some part of your document may become public. Do not include anything in a written document that would reßect poorly on you or Amazon if it appeared on the front page of the New York Times.

Did I mention spell check?!

Specifc words to avoid in documents due to legal concer ns

As a general rule in inter nal or exter nal communications, we should 

never say "market"

 if we mean "market segment" or "channel" or "space" or "business," meaning a particular part of the market (such as books or consumer electronics) or a specifc territory (such as France or Asia). 

We

should

 not use "platform," "moat," "ecosystem," or "gateway"

 when describing the services or products we o

!

er to consumers, selling partners, developers, or manufacturers (such as Selling on Amazon, Fulfllment by Amazon, Amazon Pay, Prime, Alexa, Amazon Business Accounts,

Kindle Direct Publishing, Amazon Video Direct, Dash, and Fire TV).

Words such as service, product, program, o

!

ering, marketplace/locale/country, experience, solution, business, architecture, resource, community, homepage, and other more specifc terms are better fts. We should 

not use "operating system"

 to describe anything other than true operating

systems, such as Fire OS and Windows.  For instance, we should never describe Alexa as a voice operating system.   We 

should refer to our selling partners

 when discussing Amazon vendors or sellers. Talk to your legal POC for more details.

Other words to avoid in documents

Some words/phrases are a Ôlightning rod' with senior executives at Amazon and should be avoided, unless you want to run the risk of the meeting going bad!

"Scrappy", "Test", "Scrappy test".  We spend a lot of time on little tests. Often it makes more sense to invest upfront and build it. A test is something where you scrap the development work, and we don't encourage throw-away work. A V1 should last only two to three months. If you don't get

to V2 after that, then don't do it. If it takes only a month to test, just go build it. Don't launch something that doesn't scale unless it's for a short period of time.

"Working group".  This sounds very ambiguous and consultanty.

"Beta".  See "Scrappy test".

"We", "We believe", "The team".  Preferably avoid the use of the words Ôwe' or Ôthe team' or Ôwe believe' - they can become very repetitive in documents.

"Our".  Same as above "We".  It's ok to use occasionally but not all the time.

"MVP" (minimum viable product).  Launching a MVP does not inspire confdence that you are thinking hard enough about the customer experience.  You want a customer to love your product and therefore it must be a minimum loveable product (MLP), not something that is only Ôviable'. 

Instead, use "MLP" Ð minimum loveable product.

Questions to be ready for ahead of the doc review meeting

Who is the note-taker for this meeting?

Who is the single threaded leader on this project?/Do you have a single threaded leader on this project?

Who hasn't read this doc before? (They will be asked to provide feedback frst).

How might [product/service] be abused?

What customer problem does this solve?  Why is this good for the customer?

During the meeting

Remember to answer yes/no questions with a yes/no answer.  If necessary, provide more details once you've answered yes/no.

If you don't know the answer to a question, that's OK. Say you'll fnd out and follow up.

Remember to always have a note-taker in the meeting.

Purpose

 

We are a bit peculiar about writing papers at Amazon. 

The narrative process is embedded in our culture because it has proven to be a tool that drives positive business outcomes leading to customer satisfaction and innovation. 

Lear ning how to write the Amazon way is fraught with di

!

culties

because of the iterative group process that underlies the actual writing (and re-writing) of a narrative. The objective of this Best Practice document is not to eliminate the pain of this experience (because that is how we lear n), but to prepare you for it and to reassure you that we all eventually

lear n to write a great narrative and you will, too.

Before you start

 

Read as many papers as you can, especially from your own team. 

Notice similarities and di

"

erences and ask questions of your colleagues. What were you trying to accomplish? Who was the audience? How much iteration did it take you to get to this version? If you were going to edit this

now, what would you change?

What to expect

 

The papers will most likely be very di

"

erent in their style and composition. 

There is no one "right" way to write your narrative, although you may fnd a consistent format on some teams. There are some things, however, you should see across the board: 

solid business writing, little jargon,

simple language, data that both supports and argues against the author's position, a recommendation for action, and no paper longer than six pages.

Begin your own paper: Set your goal

 

What is the purpose of the doc? What are the key questions you're trying to answer? Decision point? 

Status update? 

Deep dive into a particular aspect of a project or program? Is this topic worthy of a full six-page narrative or more suited to a one-pager?

Focus

 

State the purpose of your document at the beginning, what you will and will not cover, and be clear at the beginning of each section what it is you're presenting. 

If you need to present a lot of details to support your case, consider appendices. 

If you don't want to talk about it at a meeting,

then don't include it in the document. 

It's not about hiding anything; it's about focus and concise communication.

Structure

 

Lay out the story. Break your story into sections. 

Go painfully far in tearing apart what's really going on, separating each element, describing each element clearly and separately, and logically ßowing from one element to the next. 

Make sure each section can stand on its own and is complete.

As you review each section ask yourself: 

Do I believe this? 

What argument or data point is missing? Is there room for debate on this point? 

Think hard about the most obvious questions and objections and bake information relevant to that into the document. Build your case as you go. 

Make

sure each section builds on the last leading up to your conclusion. Litmus test: are you convinced? 

If you don't buy your own story, certainly nobody else will.

Tenets

 

An aspect of our peculiar culture is the fact that we use tenets, or guiding principles, to remind us to focus on the core mission of our teams. 

If you are writing a paper for an audience outside of your own team or function, it is useful to include your tenets to provide background on the scope

of your charter or your philosophy overall. These are typically included at the beginning of the paper, immediately following your purpose or problem statement, but may sometimes be found in the 

appendix.

Present recommendations, not just problems

 

Clearly state your recommendation. 

If the goal of your narrative is to present a decision point, make a recommendation. 

While there may be gray areas, you should have an opinion of what you would like to do and be able to explain / defend it.

Use data

 

Support your assertions with data. If you say "we should do x" follow it immediately with "because of Y and Z." 

Make sure you're confdent in the data you're presenting. If you think your data has holes, but has value and is still useful, it is better for you to point out the holes, rather than have

someone else do it during your presentation. However, more is not always better and even though you've been knee-deep in detail, present only the salient information.

Wording: choose wisely

 

Choosing the wrong word (in a narrative or in a discussion) can lead the conversation away from your point. 

Avoid using superlatives and generalities such as "many" or "often" (sometimes known as "weasel words"). Ask yourself, is this word the right word? Can I back up the use of this

word with data? If so, use the data.

Visual structure

 

You don't want just a bulleted list, but bullets and other formatting can be extremely useful to guide the reader through your document. 

Bold font, underline, italics, and even spacing can be useful visual guidance. Someone should be able to take your six-pager, ßip through the pages, and

quickly understand the story you have to tell.

Six pages means six pages (unless it's fewerÉ)

 

Amazon narratives are no more than six page Word documents, not Power Point decks. 

If you think a diagram is useful, by all means include it, but your document should be a story (not an outline with bullet points). 

Anything under 10 pt. font is cheating, and if your margins are denominated

in fractions of an inch or mm, you're probably pushing it. 

If you need more than six pages, you are saying too much. 

As Blaise Pascal said: "I would have written a shorter letter, but I did not have the time."

Press releases and FAQs

 

If you are writing a paper to propose a new product, feature, or service you will want to include a press release. This is a way to project into the future and imagine the impact on the customer of the proposal you are making. 

Many Amazonians suggest starting with the press release and then

working backwards to make your case. The FAQs are another mechanism to support your thinking as you consider in advance what questions may be asked about the product.

Use your back-pocket

 

Your appendix should include data that is needed to support your narrative. You should not expect your audience to read your appendix. 

Separate from your appendix; make sure you've got an amply flled but not distributed "back pocket." 

This is the "I-don't-think-we'll-go-there, but-just-incase-we-do" fle. 

Bring relevant fnancials analysis, technical data, and customer dataÑessentially anything that might be needed. 

And make sure you know what's in it. 

This is in service of our Leadership Principle of Dive Deep, meaning there is an expectation that you will be able to provide

additional data or background upon request and illustrate your comprehensive understanding.

Details matter: leave enough time to edit, edit, edit

 

Phrasing, spelling and grammar matter. 

A chef could cook a great meal, but if it looks terrible on the plate, people won't eat it. 

This is the easy stu

"

 Ð don't just rely on spell check ("two" and "too" are both words, after all). Read your own document several times. Start generally to get to the

content right, then read again for ßow and clarity, and for spelling and grammar. After you've re-read and re-written it twenty times your eyes may not pick up on errors. 

At that point you should either read it aloud or ask someone else to proofread it.

Engage your stakeholders

 

Consider who's going to be in your meeting. 

Who might have interesting insights or helpful suggestions that can make the document stronger? As a rule you probably don't want anything in your narrative to come as a surprise to your manager. Also consider any stakeholder who should be

on board before you take this up the chain. 

Last thing you want to have happen is to have someone in the audience say "I know nothing about this and can't support it."

The Meeting

 

Sure, you can send around the doc in advance, but don't expect that all (or anyone) will have read it by the time the meeting comes around. 

When all are in the room, you set the agenda and expectations, for example, "Our meeting today is about X. 

Please read the document and then let's

talk through Y and Z. The goal for today is to have a decision by the time we are done". 

Note: the format could also be to have everyone read the narrative and then run a Q&A session, if you don't have a specifc decision point. If there's a hot button issue that isn't relevant to this meeting,

say so: "It will also be important to discuss blah, but we'll do so in a separate meeting as our time today is limited."

The group will spend the frst 30 minutes reading quietly, after which time the discussion begins. 

Don't talk while your audience is reading. 

Don't be afraid to politely put the kibosh on a tangent and redirect! 

People understand you have an agenda to get through. 

Be an active participant Ð the

narrative is just the frst expression of your thoughts. And if someone's asking a question, listen carefully, and answer it directly. 

Yes / No, and here's why / why not (vs. talking around the question or answering a di

"

erent question altogether). And if you don't know the answer, just say so. That

comes across much better than making something up or dancing around it. 

Take notes on anything you can't answer Ð and then make sure you follow up with the group.

Take a deep breath

 and plunge in. The only way to begin writing a narrative is to get started. 

Even if you are a strong writer, you will get plenty of feedback to edit and "fx" your document so that it fts our culture and serves its purpose.

Summary

 

The writing of narratives is an important decision-making mechanism and embedded in the culture of Amazon. 

A thoughtful, data-based, and well-written paper will lead to lively discussion and, ultimately, to a commitment to a course of action. 

The writing of the paper itself serves as an

exercise in clarifying your own thoughts and recommendations and is a reßection on the clarity of that thinking. 

The best way to lear n how it works is to get started. Don't be afraid to ask for help and advice; we have all been through the lear ning curve and want to support you.

Introduction

We have several peculiar ways with regard to communication at Amazon. In particular, we use narratives rather than PowerPoint presentations at meetings. New Amazonians are likely to fnd executive meetings unusual and somewhat peculiar to Amazon. Typically, a one-hour meeting will

start with the owner of the agenda topic handing out printed documents. Ensuring a clear, concise and crisp document is critical to the success of the meeting as in most cases there is no preamble or prior context provided.

Writing narratives is embedded in our culture because it has proven to be a tool that drives positive business outcomes leading to customer satisfaction and innovation. Here are some reasons why we have such a focus on writing at Amazon:

Written documentation forces you to clarify and organize your thoughts and helps avoid misinterpretation.

We prefer the emphasis of substance over style.

Slide-based presentations are linear and ßow at the presenter's velocity; written documents allow readers to read at their pace and in any order.

Questions that come after reading an entire written document are better informed than those that arise part of the way through a slide-based presentation.

Written documents are durable. They outlive their author and the moment in time they reference.

Amazon narratives typically contain two parts, the narrative itself plus an accompanying set of appendices:

1. 

Narrative:

 The purpose of writing a narrative is to defne and describe clearly the details of a strategy, problem, solution, or initiative. From funding decisions to implementation decisions, narratives are integral to the decision-making process at Amazon. Narratives are also commonly

used for business reviews and program updates.

2. 

Set of Appendices:

 These are documents to support the narrative. They should include data and other content that strengthens the message. An appendix should not be content that you simply couldn't ft into the narrative. You should expect your audience to read the appendices,

but there is no guarantee Ð the narrative should be able to stand on its own.

Guidelines for Writing a Narrative

When writing a narrative, keep in mind that some of your fnal audience may not have much prior context, so it's important to edit a narrative into a clear, crisp set of documents.

Typical formats

Six-pagers.

 All documents at Amazon are limited to six pages of narrative with unlimited appendices. The reason is that this forces the writer to be concise and actionable with their narrative, and moves the supporting analysis to the appendix. Narratives often include the group or

project tenets, and appendices may include a Press Release, FAQs, and data and other detail relating to the topic.

One-pagers.

 This brief narrative is e

!

ective in communicating the high-level goals, tenets, and design of a project. Writing a one-pager forces the author to be very crisp about the value of a project. A well written one-pager allows the audience to quickly understand the project,

evaluate its benefts and risks, and make high-level decisions regarding it.

Typical structure of a six-pager

1. 

Purpose of the document: A concise statement of the reason for the narrative, summary recommendation, and immediate action required.

2. 

Tenets, or guiding principles, for the department, team, or project. (If you prefer, place the tenets in an appendix instead of in the main body of the document)

3. 

The details of the situation being addressed.

4. 

The recommendation for resolving the situation.

5. 

The implementation plan for the recommended solution. This typically includes the scope, schedule, sta

"

ng, and costs.

6. 

A set of appendices, such as a list of contributors, a press release, a FAQ, and supporting documents and data.

Typical structure of a one-pager

1st paragraph: The problem and recommendation summary. The background can be in an appendix.

2nd paragraph: Further explanation of the situation.

3rd paragraph: The root cause and solution. Other options considered can be in an appendix.

4th paragraph: Full recommendation and implementation plan.

Must haves

1. 

Is no more than six pages long.

 The author can provide as much supporting data as needed in an appendix, but there is no guarantee that anyone will read the appendices accompanying a narrative. It is not recommended to move text into an appendix that must be read for the

narrative to make sense. The appendices are there for reference only.

2. 

Is formatted and readable.

 There is (currently) no strict rule on font size and borders but the author must ensure that this freedom is not abused. There are no extra points for ftting more words into six pages. [See Important Tips below.]

3. 

(Ideally) Starts with the tenets of the area.

 These remind the narrative reader of the core mission of the team or the guiding principles for the project discussed in the narrative.

4. 

Clearly states the objective or purpose in the frst paragraph.

 Purpose statements are concise and provide the reader with a clear reason for the narrative, whether it is for decision-making, information sharing, a project update, or something else about the topic area.

5. 

Makes a recommendation early in the document.

 Have an upfront summary of your recommendations. Not everyone will have time to read the entire document, so help them understand your recommendation and reasoning early in the narrative.

6. 

Calls out the next steps at the end.

 Your fnal document should be the actionable long-term vision with big ideas, not a summary of what you did during the project. The recommendations should be supported by data that cover the deliverables in the short, medium, and long-term.

Consider the risks and alter natives, but present your recommendations of the best path forward with a clear roadmap for next steps.

The above requirements might seem a little odd but they have helped enforce a highly e

!

ective mechanism that drives upfront thinking, clarity and precision of thought, and alignment with the thought process. In case of regular reviews of an area, it is advised that the author maintain the

same high-level format for the narrative. The predictable and consistent format makes it easier to read the narrative over time.

Tips for Writing, Editing, and Formatting Narratives

Writing

Use this list to guide your writing and as a fnal "checklist" before presenting the narrative to your audience.

Clear purpose for the document

Data that describes the problem or current situation

Recommended solution or next steps

Data that supports the recommendation

Concise writing style, with no subjective descriptors or vague words

Visually clean, easy to read

Addresses potential concer ns or questions

No longer than 6 pages, plus appendices as needed

Additional supporting data in appendices

Draft versions reviewed by others for feedback

Editing

Use these tips during your editing process. When iterating on the document, give yourself time to write, review, re-write, get feedback, re-write, review, and re-write again.

Reduce wordiness. Eliminate subjective and vague terms. Eliminate typographical or grammatical errors. Eliminate most 

weasel words

.

Use active verbs. 

Eliminate most 

be

-verbs

: 

am, is, are, was, were, be, being, been

.  

"All requests 

are gauged

..." (passive voice) > "We 

gauge...

"

"Our proposal 

is

..." > "We 

propose

..."

"The output of this meeting will 

be

..." > "This meeting will 

produce

..."

Use spell check, but don't expect it to catch everything. Read the document aloud and read it from the bottom to the top to fnd errors that might otherwise be missed.

Ask a good writer to read it or to be your editor.

Assume readers will have questions; make sure the document answers them.

Provide relevant support that sets the context for the analysis, provides additional data, and gives examples. Eliminate the rest, or move to an appendix.

Do not digress with too many ancillary points or data that are not core to the purpose of the narrative.

Formatting

Take time to format the document properly to help readers focus on the content, not on the look of the paper. Ask your manager for local best practices for formatting.

Some organizations have document templates with the headers, footers and other information already set. Check with your manager for templates.

In the header: Name of document, date written

In the footer: 

Amazon.com Confdential, page X of Y.

 Only if directed by legal, add 

Amazon.com Privileged & Confdential, page X of Y.

Letter size paper, 1" margins, left-justifed paragraph alignment, nothing smaller than 10-point font, standard 1.0 single space lines.

Print double-sided in black and white

Keep fonts and formats consistent throughout the document

Use headings and sub-headings:

Headings

 are bold underlined

Sub-headings

 are only underlined

Numbered list preferable to bulleted lists

Present numbered lists in order of importance

Use bullet points to enumerate only when necessary

Do not leave section headings and table headings stranded on the bottom of the page.

What about Tenets in a Narrative?

An aspect of our peculiar culture is using tenets, or guiding principles. Tenets can help maintain a focus on what is important to customers by explaining how we think about critical topics that may have counterintuitive questions or answers, or answers that can't be verifed factually. They

often embody hard-won wisdom. Tenets can force ourselves to grapple with di

"

cult questions, and help remind ourselves to focus on the core mission of our teams.

In a context where readers may not be familiar with the space, it's common to place the tenets near the front of the document, e.g., immediately after the problem statement, or even immediately after the header. This can help readers understand some of the important questions in the space.

An alter native is to place tenets in the appendix, although this risks excessively deemphasizing tenets and having them become stale over time periods that exceed the durability of the tenets.

Some additional reasons to include tenets in narratives and other documents are:

They help everyone involved to align on a vision and to make decisions.

Get people excited about what the team does to deliver value to the customer.

By repeatedly looking at tenets in narratives, they become an integral part of the thought process.

Continuous exposure to tenets through narratives may reveal opportunity for refnement.

For more information about tenets, see 

Tenets

.

Tenets (A comprehensive elear ning course on KNet)

What about an FAQ and Press Release in a Narrative?

The Working Backwards documents Ð FAQs and Press Releases Ð often accompany a narrative, but not always. Visit 

Working Backwards

 for more information about this methodology and documents.

An FAQ should be at most two pages long, and lists the questions with their answers that any reader might ask when reading the narrative. Ideally, the meeting should not require any other discussion than what is outlined in the narrative and the FAQ. In addition to the list of what "Good

FAQs" do in the Working Backwards methodology, here are a few values that FAQs provide when accompanying a narrative:

Writing FAQs forces the team to anticipate important questions ahead of time. This helps with clarity and precision of thought in the narrative itself.

Good FAQs help with alignment on the decision making process related to the discussion in the main narrative. Better alignment minimizes surprises and helps with better decisions.

Good FAQs help make a narrative review meeting more e

"

cient. Ideally, all the key questions triggered by the narrative are already answered in the FAQ, thus eliminating the need for any discussion. In most cases, the meeting can be focused on the few unanswered questions.

When writing a narrative without using the Working Backwards methodology,

 here are a couple of tips for writing the FAQs specifcally for the narrative:

Make a list of 10 questions that a narrative reader might ask, and then answer them. Determine if those questions should be answered in the narrative, or handled verbally during a review meeting. If included in the narrative, tur n them into FAQs.

While conducting narrative review meetings, capture the questions you're asked. Decide if any of those should become FAQs in your next iteration or within the narrative's main body.

Prioritize the FAQs in order of importance and number them.

Whom to Involve in Writing a Narrative?

In addition to your own manager and team members, collaborate with as many relevant people as possible. This will help you anticipate the needs of your audience. If you are pitching a proposal to re-design a widget, your audience will likely ask what kind of customer feedback or tra

"

c data

do you have about this widget? If you speak to someone well-versed about this subject matter, they may alert you to this need, prompting you to answer this question in your narrative. Consider having stakeholders involved and customer representatives too. A mentor could be another good

source on how an Amazonian would present and argue certain points. See 

Conducting a Narrative Review Meeting ~ Who to invite

 for additional ideas on who to involve in writing and reviewing a narrative.

If multiple people have written parts of a narrative, the end result can be a disjointed document that diminishes the message and distracts your reviewers. When multiple writers have contributed to a document, take time to edit into a "single voice."

FAQs

I emailed the doc, why hasn't anyone replied?

Your narrative will be read in the review meeting. Je

!

 Bezos said, "Time doesn't come from nowhere. This way you know everyone has the time. The author gets the nice warm feeling of seeing their hard work being read." In addition, senior leaders may receive 6-8 documents a day Ð even if

they 

can

 read that many docs in their spare time it becomes unreasonable at that scale.

Why do leaders insist that we use 11-point font?

Many people think they're clever by using tiny fonts and tiny margins to game the system and squeeze an eight-page document into six printed pages. Here are the problems with that:

1. 

This isn't customer-obsessed. While 

you

 may have perfect eyesight, a signifcant percentage of your readers do not. And think of the folks who have probably read seven documents already today, and you show up with micro-font Ð do you think they'll be more or less receptive to your

ideas? And the margins Ð this is where readers make notes Ð if you cram your narrative into 1/2-inch margins you are depriving them of note space.

2. 

You're robbing yourself (and your team) of discussion. The objective of your doc 

isn't

 to go into a review with the answer already defned. You want to frame the problem, talk about how we should approach a solution, and lay out potential solutions. THEN you want the wisdom of the

room (which collectively exceeds the smarts and experience of any single person) to discuss the topic and give you feedback.

Wait, are you serious that you're only going to read 6 pages?

Yes (

see prior question

). Basically, six pages takes about 30 minutes for the room to read, leaving 30 minutes for discussion.

Why do people complain when I don't put page numbers and "Amazon Confdential" in the footer of my documents?

It's about attention to detail. If you can't pay enough attention to add page numbers, how can the reader trust that you paid attention to the details about the content of your document (e.g. metrics, design, etc.)?

What does my VP mean when they say "don't just bake me a cake"?

One common mistake is to write a narrative that presents only the fnal proposal, and doesn't take their reader though the tradeo

!

s and tensions the team wrestled with in getting 

to

 their proposal. Often these tradeo

!

s are most helpful in leading to a useful discussion in the room. This advice

does not, however, contradict the "lead with the solution" advice above. You need to lead with the solution so that all the tradeo

!

s can be viewed through that lens. If you take the reader on a jour ney, saving the resolution for the end, you won't get the same level of quality of insight into your

decision.

Written documents emphasize substance over style, force organization and clarity of thought, give control to the reader, generate better questions and feedback, and create a timeless reference. But in case you don't believe us, we asked leaders from across the business to share their

insights.

From your writing experience, what would be the

key pieces of advice that you would give to a

novice?

What are the top three features you

appreciate in a good document?  

What are the top three things that

you dislike in docs you have read?

US

Focus on clearly conveying insight.  Try to avoid adjectives and adverbs

that do not increase understanding.  When you assert a conclusion,

back it up with data.  When you are writing a PR/FAQ, write for

customers frst.  I fnd it helps to develop an outline, starting with the key

takeaway I want to yield

Facts, Conciseness, a narrative arc (when a story is

the right framework.)

Pictures that convey less meaning than the words

that would consume the same space, poor logic,

lack of customer focus.

US

"Perfection is achieved when there's nothing left to remove" Ð often

teams think that cramming as much info into the doc as possible (plus

adding innumerable appendices) is the best way to a) inform the

conversation and b) demonstrate their aptitude and that they are "all

over" a topic. But quite often it displays better command of a topic and

helps foster a better discussion to challenge yourself to reduce a review

or discussion to the most important elements. This phenomenon was

also expressed from a di

!

erent angle by Feynman Ð we should seek to

make our discussion of topics as simple as we can Ð this ironically

actually demonstrates masteryÉ

https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Talk:Richard_Feynman#Teaching_quote

Top 3 features: 1) simplicity, 2) discussion of

pros/cons and particularly of what is controversial

(doc writers often think it's their job to demonstrate

consensus, when expressing key disagreements is

often not only more interesting but also more helpful),

and 3) clarity of what is being requested and what the

writer recommends. Taking this last one further, the

document writer should imagine a world where the

mtg never happens and all decisions are theirs and

articulate what they would do absent additional input.

I would put docs that are too long frst on my list,

which to me implicitly expresses a lack of

organization, thought or respect for the reader (this

US

Put yourself in the reader's shoes. They are very busy and may not be as

close to the business as you are. What do you want to accomplish with

the document Ð pass along information? Get resources allocated to the

project/business? Have guidance on an issue and come to a decision?

Whatever the goal, state it early in the document, build the structure to

reinforce that purpose and wrap up the document to reach your goal. If

you have not written a doc here, have someone give you some good

examples to read and emulate.

A purpose, an organized and well formatted

document and a proper use of acronyms (used

sparingly and always defned). A good doc adds

necessary background on the issue including any

prior discussions on the topic, any recent changes in

the business, etc. The document anticipates

questions and prepares FAQ's accordingly. If done

well, the FAQ''s should handle all of the questions

your audience might have.

Rambling, disorganized documents. Small font and

little white space as if you are cramming to get

something in to the 6 pages. Over use of

appendices for KEY information that should have

been in the document. Data and data tables without

context, without summary and without conclusion.

Generally anything that is a data dump on the

reader. Also the lack of a well-reasoned

recommendation and summary of potential actions

when a decision is required.

US

If you really understand your subject, you can explain it to a stranger in 3

or 4 sentences.  That should be your goal.  It will take many iterations to

get your thoughts down, then tighten the sentences to only mention the

things that matterÉin plain and direct English.  Call a spade a spade.  If

it is a defect, call it a defect.  If it increases, say it increases.

1. Brevity and concise writing.

2. logical ßow: depending on the doc, or topic, either

ßow it through the value chain, or in each section give

the situation, what we considered, the actions we're

taking and where you need help.

3. anticipate the major questions and include them in

the FAQsÉbut do not include the kitchen sink.  It's ok

to have reference material in the meeting to answer

questions.  A doc that has too many appendices just

becomes overwhelming to the reader and gives the

impression you don't have enough command of your

topic to know the things that really matter.

1. long sentences full of numbers.  I would MUCH

RATHER have a table.  use your sentences to

explain WHY the numbers are what they are.

2. I want to understand frst thing the objective of

the doc and what you want from me.  if I'm half a

page in and I don't know this, it's distracting and

annoying. J  you've already lost me.

3. I dislike disorganized docs that don't provide a

clear roadmap on the objective, situation,

considerations/alter natives, actions, next steps/help

needed.  Some docs seem to have a multitude of

sections that don't seem to tie together into a

holistic story Ð more like throwing spaghetti on the

wall and leave it to the read to fgure out what really

matters and how to tie it together.

US

I would (strongly) encourage new writers to never start from scratch.

 Read everything that's been written about the topic before attempting to

write anything new.  If the topic is new, read docs that are somewhat

similar (plans from other product team somewhat comparable, other

Op1 or 3YP documents, etc.)   For example, when I start thinking about

my next OP1 doc, I start by going back and reading the docs we

presented the year before (as well as other teams docs.) It helps me a lot

thinking about the various topics we covered and ensure I don't miss

(early on) key initiatives.

I'm sometimes surprised when reading a doc that's not as great as I'd

like it to be that the author has not leveraged the work of others.  In most

cases, someone has written a document about a similar topic in the

past.  This is especially true of Inter national teams that can (usually)

beneft from the work that might have been done in other locales.

Writing a good doc is a process. It takes a number of iterations.  It can

be a very rewarding & helpful process as it contributes to answering

questions, resolving issues that were not surfaced before the creation of

the doc.   Good doc writers have an e

!

ective process in place:  review

drafts and discuss each paragraph/ issues / challenge and assign

sections to various contributors.  Regroup and discuss again, and

againÉ  It takes time but a well done doc is a well-crafted plan which

pays o

!

 in the long run.

Clarity, simplicity.  I have noticed that it is sometimes

helpful to ask the teams to start each section with

their goals (as in, for example, "Increases Selection

from CN sellers from X to Y a X% increase YoY by

implementing 5 new initiatives" ) This can help

focusing the document / section of key, needle

moving topics (i.e the 5 initiatives.)

This approach (being super clear as to what are the

goals / summary of each section) is particularly

helpful for writer whose English might not be as

"native" as one would like it to be. 

Documents that are hard to read are papers where

the reader is not provided the context and clear

defnitions of what we are talking about (what is the

purpose of the doc? What is the defnition of the

program?) etc.

Avoid long sentences.  They are hard to write and

(usually) harder to read.

Ensure that others read docs before they are

presented.  Fresh eyes (and brains) quickly spot

what might be confusion, unclear.

US

Gather 

your 

data so it's ready to insert, then create a storytelling outline.

You have to lay it out in a way that leads the reader through your thought

process and logically builds your case block by block. Then by the time

you present your recommendation, it makes perfect sense.

Concise, clear, multiple options even though there is a

recommendation (it's just as important for me to see

what you considered and rejected)

Confused narrative where it's hard to follow the

logic, too small font or tables that are hard to read, a

6-pager with 15 pages of appendices that are

required reading for the discussion (that's cheating).

EU

Learn and be curious. Take/study Amazon writing wikis/classes. Find a

great doc and analyze why. Participate in group doc writing and reads.

1. Clear writing that avoids unnecessary words and

doesn't waste time talking about generic info. Make it

clear, to the point and directly relevant.

2. Good organization and logical flow with the right

supporting data ... not millions of appendices Ôjust in

case'. Be deliberate and save trees.

3. Inspirational, innovative, thinking big AND having

business minded, scoped, and reasonably quantified

investment case.

Useless adjectives. Unquantified Ôbigness' words ...

huge, very significant, sizable. Sloppy formatting,

spelling errors and NUMBERS THAT DON'T TIE

OUT IN CHARTS OR ARE DIFFERENT IN TEXT!

UK

Understanding your position and what you want to convey is the most

important element. This requires more thought and iterations than you

expect so spend plenty of thinking and outlining time before you start

composing text. Once you're clear on what you want to say, composing

text is about making sure others understand your POV as simply and

defensibly as possible. Find the right simple, widely-resonating

examples. This is a great way to convey a complex point quickly.

Don't be afraid to change your position as you compose the doc.

Forcing clarity of thinking through composition is the real reason we

write docs at Amazon.

A great doc is bor n through lots of review and iterations. This requires

time to edit, walk away, review and repeat. Always be looking for ways to

say the same thing with less words. Keep an open mind to input from

your reviewers and be willing to change your mind if they've thought of

something you haven't. You can edit forever so time-bound your

investment proportional to the importance of the doc and be done when

you're done.

(1) It's easily understood by laymen.

(2) It's interesting and engaging because the right

points are emphasised and the author has

demonstrated depth of thinking.

(3) It takes a thoughtful defensible position.

(1) Verbosity and tangents without objectives.

(2) Data for the sake of data.

(3) Over-emphasis on the how or the why. Both are

essential.

EU

The key is to be clear about the narrative. You need to be clear about the

point you want to make, and be equally clear on how you are going to

move from the initial situation (usually Ð what problem are we trying to

solve or what is the current status of that business?) to the point you are

trying to make

Clarity, preciseness without being overwhelmed by

details, and nearly all documents have to have the

answer to the question: Ôwhat are we doing to

improve CX'

Unimportant details that makes it harder to follow

the thought process, not-well thought through FAQ

(both in terms of defning the questions and

answering), verbosity

EU

- prepare with your team/peers. What are the questions we anticipate,

what data do we need, what preparation reviews do we need with

whom.

- Pay specifc attention to the executive summary. Make it simple. Not

hiding complexity, but building a storyline. This is your best chance to

direct the audience

- have it read by several. They will help anticipate questions

- best documents include a section on how readers can help

- easy to read

- questions preempted

- eye opening data. You can make a hit with one good

table

- repetitions. Either of sentences, or sentences

repeating tables with no insight

- unclear paragraphs adding facts and numbers

without a "so what?"

- obvious facts missing

EU

Write documents in such a way that they can be read by any person in

Amazon and not only people familiar with the topic

-Good exec summary

-Clear structure, maybe using the pyramid principle

-Right amount of data with clear synthesis based on

the data

No document hygiene (page numbers, Amazon

confdential, liberal use of market defnition, font size

smaller then point 10, missing bullet

points/numbering/ headings)

UK

1. Lots of great examples of good (and bad!) documentsQBR out there -

start by working out what your document is for (QBR, MBR, 6 / 2 / 1

pager to drive a decision, Je

!

 B escalation response...) then go fnd a

great example to model it on!

2. Always think "reader" - e.g. if the document is to help inform a

decision, what information does the reader need to reach that decision

3. Great documents make complex subjects simple - not the other way

round!

1. Clear structure

2. Pithiness - exactly the information needed but no

more

3. Attention to the basics (page numbers, Amazon

confdential, Amazon tone, consistency of data

format)

1. 30 page appendices for 30minute meetings!

2. Obvious questions not addressed

3. Rambling unclear structures indicating lack of

clarity in the thinking.

Be prepared and search for Feedback a good doc always needs several

iterations no matter how genius you think you are

Precision/accuracy, crisp wording and short as it can

be ( not put 100 pages in the appendix as an

example)

Not using data to size a topic (e.g. A large impact, a

huge number of xx, ...)

- Using too many acronyms (worst case without

even spelling them out once)

- Not using a table when a table explains the

context easiest.

EU

Nothing is better for lear ning to write at Amazon than writing at

Amazon. 

!

 Meaning, no amount of training or wikis or advice can

be more powerful than just writing and getting as many repetitions

writing as possible. People should lean into those opportunities

and create opportunities to write formallyÉand then tur n to more

experienced writers in the org for feedback. This is the way the

muscle gets built.

Honor the format/Format matters. There are very specifc

expectations around writing narratives, and these are not up for

discussion. Things like font size, margins, etc. all matter deeply to

a high quality document. People shouldn't confuse the fact that

content speaks louder than formatting.

Data and background matters. Making sweeping statements in

Amazon narratives is not ideal. Saying things like "this presents a

signifcant market opportunity" is am empty comment with no

context or data to back-up the comment. Whenever a descriptor

is used, there needs to be facts, data, or customer anecdotes to

back-up the comment.

Flow of the story you are telling matters. The narrative needs to

start with a clear/compelling problem or opportunity statement

that shows the reader what he or she is about to read (and why

the topic matters). Shift then to providing baseline/current state

information to ensure that the reader shares a common

understanding of the current state. Then shift to initiatives and

actions that you want to take to either exploit the opportunity or

mitigate the risk of the problem statement.

Stay away from pronouns whenever possible Ð like I, we, etc.

Wrap-up with a conclusion that sums-up your points and calls to

action.

Ideally, narratives should be written to drive understanding and

decision-makingÉso it is important that we push ourselves to

write in a way that both informs the audience and provides

enough information to help make a decision. The author cannot

assume that the reader has the same intimate knowledge as the

him or herself.

#

 Don't use long paragraph with numbers. You lose everyone. Use

tables. And then in the commentary explain the take away of the table.

#

 Show only numbers that help build your argument. This is true also for

appendixes.

#

 Use the right format and have a clear problem defnition:

a. If it is to launch a new program Ð use PR & FAQ format.

b. If there's a major issue you need to solve, use a framework as

situation / complication / resolution.

c. If it is an update you need to give (e.g. a QBR), call out the 3 biggest

things you want to discuss. E.g. I want to give you an update on x and

seek feedback on y and z.

#

 Think always frst who this doc is addressed to. If it is to an SVP, there's

a 100% chance that she does not remember all the context and the

history of what happened. Give all the background he needs.

#

 If there's a recommendation give options.

#

 Think about all the angles of an issue. You own anticipating the

question.

#

 You don't have to write 6 pages. Many times 3 or 2 is enough.

#

 Remember what is in the doc. Mark it Privilege & Confdential if you

address data related to negotiations, competitive environment. Ensure

the meeting is mark as P&C. Have an exter nal counsellor in the room.

And I could keep writingÉ 

#

 By far, conciseness.

#

 Clear problem defnition and clear recommendation

with quantifed implication.

#

 Strong judgment in the recommendation

#

 Long and convoluted.

#

 "Data dumps" Ð those drive me ballistic.

#

 Lack of judgment in the recommendation.

FR

- Put yourself in the shoes of your audience: make sure you have

thought of and addressed all the big questions they might have, across a

diverse variety of people (Retail, 3P, Operations, CS, Prime, Finance,

etc.). This will help you draft a better recommendation.

- Do not neglect form: a poorly formalized document will be a signal that

you are not insisting on the highest standards. In my experience, when

my frst reaction to a document is that form is bad, I quickly realize that

susbstance is also poor.

- Once you have a decent V1 of your document, you should tur n yourself

into a "hairdresser": pick-up your scissors, and then do a frst round of

cutting unnecessary things. Take each sentence and try to say the same

thing with half the words. Then, do a round 2. You will be surprised how

satisfying it is to have a crisper narrative. If that helps you go from 6

pages to 3 pages, don't be afraid: your readers will be much happier to

read 3 dense and crisp pages, rather than 6 fuzzy pages, even if 6 is the

magic number at Amazon.F16

- A table that replaces a ton of text

- Well laid-out issue-based sections (around 10-15

lines max) that make the point. Start with the title of

the issue in bold, and then continue with the narrative

right after.

- A long FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions) covering

all potential questions from the customer and from

Amazon teams/functions.

- I really dislike when it is clearly visible that the

writer used tricks to increase the amount of text,

such as using an abnormally small font size (below

Calibri 10) or very thin margins. To me this is a signal

that the thinking is not sharp, and that the writer did

not spend enough time to sharpen thinking. We

should be also wary of not using too many

acronyms, or at least defning those, for instance in

a glossary or footnotes. You cannot imagine how

many acronyms seem obvious to the writer, but not

at all to the readers!

- On substance, it is disappointing when obvious

FAQs are missing, since this is often the key part of

the document: put yourself in the shoes of your

audience!

- I also dislike when the appendix is flled with a

huge amount of tables that do not really make a

point, or are useless in the context of the

discussion. Sometimes, doc writing tur ns into a

contest of Ôwho will have the biggest appendix', this

is a shame!

FR

- Structure / Working backwards docs. Read a lot/

- Who is your audience

- What are you trying to solve?

- Is what I'm about to produce not overlapping with other teams.

- Avoid procrastination. Better have one iteration than none. Best docs

have had several iterations. All the more true in promo docs. SBI

examples are worth more than adjectives.

- 1-Pager is a great guide on something you're actually dealing with

every day. Doing a 1-pager can be a source of time saving.

- Focus on emails: emails should focus on answering the question

asked. Emails should have context and narratives too. Stick to facts and

avoid adjectives.

To share 

- Have a clear purpose

- Concrete Solutions

- Applicable results

- Unclear Context

- Inaccuracies

- No measurable e

!

ects

- Lack of simplifcation / mysterious acronyms

FR

- Be clear in your doc about what you expect from the meeting and from

the stakeholders attending the meeting. Is it FYI, do you want to validate

some actions?, etc. An exec summary can help.

- Be as simple as possible and as short as possible. Don't add

unnecessary appendix. If it's possible to have a one pager, better than a

two pager, etc.

- Be careful with reusing the past version of a doc and complete it.

- Troubleshoot your doc : read it and challenge it as if you were a

stakeholder it is presented to. Do that over and over until you're sure it's

bullet proof.

- Use FAQ. Spend some time to select which are the right one.

- Don't use abbreviations unless everybody knows them for sure.

Start with your storyline, then build your structure , for each part deliver

the key message frst  and follow with facts to back it up.

Then proofread your doc to check how to make it 10 times simplier /

shorter

Avoid long list of appendices and be very selective in what can be

helpful.

Proofread again as if you were one of the stakeholders reading the doc

for the frst time (role play) and chase for things you don't understand if

you are not the expert of the topic : and simplify again.

Finally, make sure the doc conveys the key messages sharply; identifes

clear action items/owners/ETA and that you clarify the mechanism to

audit/ review and make it clear where you need support from your

audience. 

- conciseness

- self - explanatory

- clear messages and action items

#

 Start with a straw man (le squelette - in English, a skeleton) of your doc

in order to have the ßow and the organization of your thoughts, plus the

sizing of the di

!

erent parts of the document, allocate who does what in

the doc. Ask yourself, what is the story, the key message you want to

convey

#

 When it is a group e

!

ort, like an OP1 doc, start on One Note, be very

specifc about the size of the contribution and then move soon enough

(at least 2 weeks before deadline) to a word version with one owner

otherwise you will be in a position of having to cut and rewrite the whole

document which is the most painful exercise to make

#

 Leave the exec summary to the end as it will capture the whole

document. 

#

 A good exec summary so I am clear about the key

message, the key take out and the key decision we

are supposed to take

#

 I like when there is a detail of actions after the fact

been exposed, (the FR QBR of Q1 was a good

example of that, what did we observe and what are

the actions taken in response of the facts that are

elaborated)

#

 FAQ is really key as this is where most of the points

are really built in and where we address very

important points, rumor says that Je

!

 in big reviews is

only focusing on FAQ as this is where the "meat" is.  

#

 Long and complex series of numbers in a text so

you don't know what is what and it is confusing

(sometimes it's easier to put a short summary within

the body of the doc (again a good example is the

VM bridge in the last Q1 FR QBR)

#

 Verbiose text not getting to the points and

ambiguous formulas

#

 Oversized and too long documents that

demonstrate inability to get to the core of it, if the

review is 1h then the doc should be 6 pages max

and 4-5 pages of appendix

FR

Prepare in advance: complete your narrative "on time" Ð meaning early.

Edit, edit, edit: you should iterate on several drafts. Use peer review

when possible. Engage necessary stakeholders in preparation: avoid

surprise and help get alignment in advance.

#

 For emails:

o Know your audience: composure applies to emails

as well.

o Keep it short: you can read it on a smartphone.

o Keep it simple: use clear and concise sentences

and no jargon. Avoid distractions like inside jokes,

loaded terminology, strange fonts and caps.

#

 For pagers:

o Be concise so one does not waste the readers' or

each other's' time, but there is a need to explain the

nuances of an issue when necessary.

o The narrative should stand on its own Ð anyone

should be able to pick it up and understand.

o Present recommendations not just problems or

information (unless information only is the objective).

o Deal with facts and information Ð avoid opinions

and conjecture. 

#

 For emails:

o Unstructured documents: when the doc does not

lead with the conclusion, recommendation, or main

statement, and it is not supported with a limited

number of ideas.

o Emails that do not anticipate chur n: one should

anticipate likely questions and answer them.

o Emails that do not pass the "NY Times test" and

do not assume that it may be forwarded and

potentially read by others.

#

 For pagers:

o Absence of structure: one should clearly state the

objective in the frst paragraph, make a

recommendation or call out next steps at the

beginning or end.

o Documents lacking consistency, not using good

writing style, grammar, punctuation, using passive

voice.

#

 Keep it simple Ð assume your reader isn't an expert, avoid jargon and

make the text readable

#

 Keep it crisp Ð less is more Ð 6 pages is an upper bound not a target.

The best docs are often only a couple of pages.

#

 Tenets are often helpful to quickly align the reader on your mental

model and some of the best doc discussions are getting feedback from

your leaders on those tenets

 Expect multiple revisions as you perfect the paper. Make sure you build

cient time for iteration and feedback. Get others to read it for you

and take their feedback as a gift

#

 Insist on the highest standards Ð Amazon has certain traditions and

expectations for what a doc looks like. Follow them (e.g. font size,

convention for large numbers etc). Small errors make the reader think

you don't have high standards Ð this isn't so much about the doc but

what it suggests might also be the case of your work more generally

#

 The doc review is as much lear ning experience for you as it is an

opportunity for you to get feedback and direction from the audience. A

good doc isn't about communicating info (although it does that) its about

aligning on a mental model and set of actions and goals

The most important part of the writing exercise is to clearly identify what

is the problem you are trying to solve and write about it clearly. All the

argumentation and data should be related to that fundamental problem

solving assumption.

At the beginning do not focus on "wordsmithing" so much Ð I rather

focus on the structure and the ßow of arguments that are backed up

with data. The fnal details of the wording will com through the iterative

details/ info matter

(i) redundancy of information (e.g., Ôwordization' of

tables with numbers); (ii) pointless abundance of

details; (iii) lack of clarity in meeting's objectives

ITES

- Always start by thinking who will be reading the doc

decision, a recommendation, just FYI)

- understanding what information they need to give you the output

Plan time to revise the document with the sole goal to make it easier to

- Start early, ie don't write your doc on the eve of the meeting; plan for

time to iterate with other stakeholders, ask them to challenge your

thinking and provide their inputs;

- Once you have produced a frst draft, iterate multiple times to trim the

fat from your writing (http://www.sbkline.com/tips/29-tips/72-trimfat)

DE

#

 The frst question to address should be "when do I need a doc"? And

then, what docs formats for what goal/audience? (PR FAQ, 2-pager,

emails..etc?). Do you need iteration (with limited initial input and take it

step-by Step) or is the situation calling for a full 6-pager from the get go.

#

 Be factual and data-driven, but remain concise (do not try to hide lack

of logic under useless details)

#

 Work your context / think big. Documents should always have a "So

What" explaining why the document matter is important, and recon next

steps. 

#

 A good structure is a must. This will onboard the

reader on a train of thought faciliatating on problemsolving

#

 A good appendix is a must: more is better than

lessÉ but to a certain extent Ð if a number is called

out in the text, the table carrying the story should

belong in the appendix if not too extreme.

#

 Early Context and intent of the doc is welcome.

#

 Appendix should include supporting data.

Paramount info should be included in the main text.

#

 Large Executive summaries (too long or failing to

capture the complexity) should be avoided.

#

 The language quality should be meeting a certain

level to avoid distraction. Writing simple sentences

is a must to avoid this.

Why Writing Well is Important at Amazon

Written documents emphasize substance over style, force organization and clarity of thought, give control to the reader, generate better questions and feedback, and create a timeless reference. For these reasons Amazon prefers written documents to PowerPoint presentations, and makes

extensive use of them for communicating ideas and information. The skill of good writing is important to master to be successful at Amazon.

"Full sentences are harder to write. They have verbs. Paragraphs have topic sentences. There is no way to write a six-page, narratively structured memo and not have clear thinking." ~ Je

!

 Bezos

"Writing is the entire process by which we discover what we are trying to say." ~ Patrick E. McLean

"The skill of writing is creating a context in which other people can think." ~ Edwin Schlossberg

Read what 

other leaders think

, including their likes and dislikes.

Note that PowerPoint presentations are used within Amazon but mostly for lear ning and development programs, all-hands, and summit meetings. Presentations are used for sharing information, not decision-making. A strongly held belief at Amazon is that you can't make good decisions

based on a PowerPoint presentation.

Take the time to invest in improving your writing. Here are some techniques to help you do that:

1. 

Practice, practice, practice! Not a surprising piece of advice, but in our time-starved environment, it can be hard. Here are some specifc practice tips.

Focus on the writing every time you read Ð whether it be a short email or a 6 pager, analyze whether it is clear and well written Ð or not; and in both cases if it is an Amazon written piece, provide the feedback to your colleague and invest in them.

O

!

er to edit other colleagues' writing. They will always beneft from a fresh set of eyes and you will see di

!

erent styles and approaches you can apply to your writing; plus you will lear n more about Amazon and again invest in your colleagues.

Look for opportunities to write outside of Amazon whether it be blogs or posts Ð the feedback you get there will also help you improve your writing.

2. 

Ask a diverse set of colleagues (across teams and levels) to read and critique your writing. Tell them you want them to be as constructive as they can since you are trying to improve.

3. 

Take writing classes or seminars. An individual brought in an English professor known to help business people write clearly for some of their teams as well as a renowned legal writer when the individual led legal teams. This is a craft and there is much to lear n from the professionals

who study it especially if they know how to translate it into our world.

4. 

O

!

er to write the frst draft of key team papers. It is the hardest to write the frst version but you also lear n the most and you show leadership.

5. 

Participate in working backwards e

!

orts like the 

Plus Ultra Contest

.

6. 

Make your writing a focus with your mentor and manager. Make sure you know what you need to do to improve and know if you are making progress.

This wiki builds on the work of many individuals to help you write e

!

ectively at Amazon. We use several di

!

erent written formats, each one helping to drive upfront thinking and clarity of thought. This wiki will help you know when to use each format. You will fnd summary information directly

below on the common types of narratives or documents. Each section links to an expanded wiki page. On those pages you will fnd guidelines, examples, and other links to additional resources.

If you have additional guidelines, examples, or links to resources on writing at Amazon, please contribute to the individual wiki pages.

Follow Local Guidelines when Writing

This wiki and linked pages include general best practices for writing at Amazon, plus a host of resources. Di

!

erent organizations at Amazon have their own ways of writing. The guidance o

!

ered in the wiki should be verifed with your manager for the preferred writing styles and formats used

in your group. Ask for successful writing examples from your manager, peers, and team members before writing a document; read documents from outside your organization; and most importantly Ð practice. Write, review, re-write, get feedback, re-write, review, re-write. Enjoy the process of

discovering, clarifying, and refning your ideas.

Tenets

Tenets are a few, carefully articulated guiding principles for a program or business area. They act as an e

!

ective guide for the team, stakeholders, and senior leaders to align on a vision and decisions. Tenets simplify decision-making and help with being right more often; they can be used as

tiebreakers when making tough judgment calls. Tenets are ultimately aligned with Amazon's mission and core values. At the same time, tenets are specifc to the program or the business area and aligned with its mission and vision. Narratives and other documents often state tenets at the

beginning of the document or include them in an appendix, allowing the team to repeatedly look at them and become an integral part of their thought process.

Working Backwards Documents

Our mission as a company is to be Earth's most customer-centric company, and our most successful projects start with the customer and work backwards. It's not just a way of thinking, but also a methodology that gives us relentless customer focus. Three tools comprise the Working

Backwards methodology: a Press Release, an FAQ, and Visuals. Each tool is used to drive clarity into what we want to build and why. As a set of documents, these are the currency we use to share our ideas, to test our ideas, and to bring our ideas to life for customers.

Find guidelines and resources about this topic here.

Narratives Ð Writing a Document

We have several peculiar ways with regards to communication at Amazon. In particular, we use narratives rather than PowerPoint presentations in meetings. Writing narratives is embedded in our culture because it has proven to be a tool that drives positive business outcomes leading to

customer satisfaction and innovation. Amazon narratives typically contain two parts, the narrative itself plus an accompanying set of appendices:

Narrative:

 The purpose of writing a narrative is to defne and describe clearly the details of a strategy, problem, solution, or initiative. From funding decisions to implementation decisions, narratives are integral to the decision-making process at Amazon. Narratives are also commonly

used for business reviews and program updates. The most common narrative formats at Amazon are the one-pager and the six-pager.

Set of Appendices:

 These are documents to support the narrative. They should include data and other content that strengthens the message. An appendix should not be content that you simply couldn't ft into the narrative. You should expect your audience to read the appendices, but

there is no guarantee Ð the narrative should be able to stand on its own.

Find guidelines and resources about this topic here.

Narratives Ð Conducting a Meeting

Meetings at Amazon often start by everyone silently reading a document (or narrative) such as a proposal, project update, key data, or metrics for anywhere from ten to 30 minutes depending on the topic. While reading, people make notes and prepare for the discussion that will follow. No

projector is provided for a PowerPoint presentation. The copies of the documents you bring are the only material for the meeting. Your narrative and supporting documents should be written so that anyone without background is able to understand them. To achieve this in your writing, you

will beneft from having people read your narrative and examine your arguments even before you present your documents to your fnal audience.

Find guidelines and resources about this topic here.

OP1 Documents

OP stands for "Operating Plan." In the OP1 and OP2 meetings, decisions are made on how the company will proceed in the upcoming year as well as streamlining strategies for the next several years. Headcount, capital expenditures, operating costs and other budgets are deliberated and

decisions are made about what company investments to make and projects to focus on.

Find guidelines and resources about this topic here.

Promotion Documents

Quality promotion documents are crucial to ensuring employees are given the best chance of receiving a promotion, and should be undertaken with great thought and care. A promotion document (or a promo doc) should be written for any career development promotion to a higher level.

Generally, lateral moves with no level change do not require a promo doc.

Find guidelines and resources about this topic here.

Correction of Errors (COEs)

The intent of the Correction Of Errors (COE) process is to improve the overall availability of our services and to drive accountability to each appropriate service owner. As part of the resolution of every Impact One ticket (and some Impact Two), the owner of resolution will fll out a COE

containing:

A description of what went wrong.

The cost and impact of the event.

Lessons lear ned from the event, on an individual and company level.

Action items that should be undertaken to prevent recurrences.

Find guidelines and resources about this topic here.

Escalation Documents

Documents are expected for any escalation meeting. Good escalation documents are concise, describe the business problem without casting blame, list quantitative pros and cons of di

!

erent options, and make a recommendation.

E-mail Communications

Here are some email communication best practice tips. Some will seem obvious because they are! But it is also not so easy to remember to apply them in all situations when moving fast.

Structure

1. 

Make it as short as you can. Use as few words as possible and shorter sentences; go back after writing an email and see if there are words, phrases or sentences that are not required.

2. 

Use active voice which means your subject is doing the action and the action is your verb. "We need to take action" rather than "Action needs to be taken."

3. 

Use plain English (or your language of choice); a good test is "Would someone who knows nothing about your area understand what you are trying to communicate?"

4. 

Break up information into logical paragraphs with white space to make it more readable

5. 

Use numbers instead of bullets for lists, especially if they are actions

Content

1. 

Provide clear guidance: what is the answer, or what do you want your audience to do or to know?

2. 

If you need information or action, make that clear and pose simple questions or provide direction including who owns actions

3. 

Include a reasonable deadline if asking for information or action

4. 

Put the most important information up front in the email and make sure it is readable on one screen of a phone

5. 

Review and edit before sending

Audience

1. 

Ask yourself whether email is the right vehicle. If the content is sensitive or complex, maybe a meeting or phone call is better

2. 

Make sure it has the right tone and length for the targeted audience; if unsure, ask someone to review

3. 

Avoid loaded words (emotion is not well communicated in email) and acronyms (spell them out frst)

4. 

Those in the "to" line should be the ones you expect to respond

5. 

Make it clear when people are added and removed; avoid adding unnecessary recipients and remove recipients when no longer required

6. 

Be very careful while putting email lists in BCC, as that breaks people's email flters.

Mechanics

1. 

Provide a good Subject line and let people know whether action is required or if this is FYI; include TIME SENSITIVE only if it truly is

2. 

Ask yourself is this Privileged, Confdential or both and mark accordingly

3. 

Use "Important" sparingly

4. 

Be careful with large attachments; if it is needed, can you provide a link instead?

5. 

Don't just forward a string; summarize and make the actions' need or reason for forwarding clear

Chime/IM Communications

Here are some Chime/instant messaging communication best practice tips.

1. 

Know when to IM vs. Email - IMs are great for back and forth, multiple questions, urgent items or for immediate help; IMs aren't easily forwarded

2. 

Use Chime as a great tool for cross-device messaging

3. 

Follow the email rules in IM Ð brief, ask up front

4. 

Worst IM ever is: "Hello" with nothing else.

Basic Steps for Publishing a *New* Whitepaper or Blog Post at AWS

1. 

Come up with a great idea for content!

2. 

Search High Spot and the AWS Website for existing content that might already have been published about your topic. Make sure your idea is meaningfully di

!

erent from other variations. Whitepapers, guides, and blog posts should not be "variations on a theme" or replicate material

that might be in the service documentation.

3. 

If you're interested in writing a blog post, go to the 

AWS Blog wiki

, where you can submit a proposal to the category of your choice.

4. 

If you're interested in writing a whitepaper or longer-form technical guide, go to the 

Tech Content 2.0 wiki

 and open a content project.

5. 

Domain advisors who are familiar with the technology will review your idea and might have feedback for you.

6. 

Once you get a green light, you'll write the draft of your content. Make sure to follow the templates and guidelines of your publishing destination. These are documented in the wikis.

7. 

Your content will go through multiple iterations of review for technical accuracy. This could include peer reviewers, service team reviewers, Marketing reviewers, Legal reviewers, and others, depending on what you're writing about.

8. 

A Blog Bar Raiser or a technical editor will do an editorial QA check of your content and might ask you to do some additional cleanup.

9. 

The fnal content will be published.
