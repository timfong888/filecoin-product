The Dear Customer Letter 
The 
CXBR
 team is testing out an optional alternative to the 
Press Release
 called the "Dear Customer Letter." Since Press Releases are announcements to the press (not the customer) and they speak about customers in the third person, they
can sometimes be an awkward mechanism for putting oneself in the customer's shoes. A "Dear Customer Letter" can be a more natural exercise since it speaks directly to the customer. Also, since an actual letter (e.g. email or Gateway
message) to customers would be an interruption, this format naturally sets a high bar for crisply describing the benefit of what's being announced in terms the customer will understand.
For internal-facing projects, this new format is especially natural because they almost always result in an announcement email sent to internal customers. So, the idea is to write that email at the beginning of the project to help you get clarity.
Using the info and examples below, we encourage you to try it out and tell us about your experience: 
CXBR-Questions@
Suggested Template
Should be no more than 5 paragraphs. Speak directly to the customer (e.g. use ÒyouÓ). Use language that is informal, positive, simple and playful (should ooze with excitement).
Dear Customers,
WeÕre excited to announceÉ
 2-3 sentences describing what weÕve created for customers, the most important benefit for the customer and why the customer would care. This paragraph sets the context.
Describe the New Product or Service.
 Provide examples - the more specific the better. Explain how this is an improvement for the customer experience. If you've solved a customer frustration, explain how you solved it.
Call to Action.
 Encourage the customer to try out the new product or service. Provide a straight forward way for the customer to find the new product or service. Also, explain how they can find the product or service in the future (e.g. Just go to any detail page and you'll see...)
Take Credit for the Great Thing You've Built
 Explain why we built this for the customer (e.g. ÒWe're working hard to make your experience betterÓ). Take credit for the impressive thing you've built in a way that is subtle and sophisticated (without boasting).
Learn More.
 Tell the customer where to go learn more.
Thank the Customer.
: 
Thank you for being a customer.
Your Signature.
 Sign your name and the name of your team.
FAQs about the Dear Customer Letter
What is a Dear Customer Letter?
 It's a letter you write directly to the customer telling them about your new launch. Imagine posting the letter on the Amazon Gateway or sending an email to customers. In the letter, you speak directly to the customer about your launch and how it benefits
them. The letters should be short and to-the-point because our customers' time is valuable. Therefore, this format means you must boil things down to their bare essence and crisply describe the benefit of the launch using language the customer easily understands. This "customer
interruption" aspect also helps you set a high bar for what's being announced.
Can I use this for internal-facing projects (e.g tools for Amazon employees)
 Yes, the Dear Customer Letter is a natural fit since new launches are typically announced via emails sent to the appropriate mailing list. In this case, the Working Backwards methodology is as simple as
writing the announcement email and FAQs at the beginning of the project.
Is this replacing 
Press Release
?
 No. This an alternative to the Press Release. The Press Release is not being deprecated. You can choose which format works best for your project. Remember these are tools to help you achieve clarity and customer focus.
Do I have to write both a Press Release and Dear Customer Letter?
 No, but you can. If writing both helps you achieve clarity and customer focus then write both.
Do I also write 
FA Q s
 and 
create visuals
?
 Yes. To fully embrace Working Backwards, you will create a Working Backwards document that includes FAQs and Visuals.

Announcing Frustration Free Packaging (2008)

What are Working Backwards FAQs?
Writing Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) is an important step in the 
Working Backwards process.
 Like 
Press Releases
, FAQs are a tool that
drives customer focus and clarity for decisions we make on any project at Amazon. Use FAQs to channel your customer and anticipate
answers to questions that stakeholders may ask while you are planning and executing your project. While the Press Release describes the
essence of your idea, the FAQs provide details and data. 
FAQs accompany the 
Press Release
 (PR) with questions (and your answers) that will be asked after reading the press release or discussing
the project. Gather new questions as you review your PR with individual reviewers, partner teams, and stakeholders. FAQs will be several
pages long and can be quite detailed.
There are two types of FAQs questions Ð customer FAQs and Stakeholder FAQs. Customer FAQs are questions you expect a customer may
ask. These questions help you retain focus on delighting customers. Stakeholder FAQs are inter nal business questions that other leaders,
partner teams, or other Amazonians may ask you. 
A well-written FAQ is important to the Working Backwards process because:
Good FAQs help us vet an idea. While we may fall in love with the idea in the Press Release, the FAQs help us get into the details of
how it will work for customers and how we'd execute.
Writing FAQs uncovers risk and helps us assess the feasibility and complexity of what we want to do.
Good FAQs capture the decisions made for a project along the way. It's a living document.
Good FAQs help make team meetings more e
!
cient. Ideally, all the key questions triggered by the Press Release are already answered
in the FAQs thus eliminating the need for any discussion. In most cases, the meeting can be focused on the few unanswered questions.
You'll note that FAQs are often included as an appendix in narratives (e.g., 6-Pagers). For more information about the role of FAQ in narratives,
please visit 
Writing a Narrative
.

Tips for Writing FAQs
Jumpstart your FAQs by sharing your Press Release with other Amazonians who know very little about your space and capturing their
questions.
Answer all the 'must-have' default questions included in the template, and expand on those with new questions
Include both customer FAQs and stakeholder FAQs.
If you have more than one set of customers, include FAQs for all customer sets.
For example, if your customers are authors and readers, write FAQs for both.
If you don't know how to provide a good answer for an FAQ, still include the question. This signals to other readers that you are aware
of it, which helps ear n trust. Other readers may be able to help advise you. Include the question, and answer it with something like
"TBD. We don't know the answer and plan to have this answered by TK (Þll in the blank) date."
Bonus points for explaining how and when you'll Þgure out the answer.
If you ask a yes-no question, the answer should start with "yes" or "no" before providing additional details.
Include 'hard questions'.
What are the questions you are hoping wonÕt be asked?
What questions do you not yet know the answer to?
Imagine what your customers will be most frustrated about or surprised by and include those as FAQs.

Working Backwards Press Release
The press release is a one-page narrative explaining the project vision using customer-centric language. With the press release, we 
leap into
the future
 and imagine how we want customers to feel and what we want them to say when they experience the product, feature, or service
that we want to create. Writing a press release clariÞes how customers will see the idea, not just how we think and speak about it inter nally. It
is also a fantastic tool to help drive the right conversations with development teams and stakeholders.
Getting started
To help you get started, 
download the Working Backwards template
. In each section, you'll Þnd instructions, tips, and guidance for all three
components of the Working Backwards process (
Press Release
, 
FAQs
, and 
Visuals
). You can also Þnd a breakdown of the press release
section of the template below.
 
The 5 Customer Questions
To help you get started, try answering these Þve customer questions. Having clear answers to these questions will help you write
your press release and will also help you clarify your thinking:
1. 
Who is the customer?
2. 
What is the customer problem or opportunity?
3. 
What is the most important customer beneÞt?
4. 
How do you know what customers need or want?
5. 
What does the customer experience look like?
Lear n about the 5 Customer Questions on Working Backwards Online
Suggested Outline
Here is a suggested outline for the Press Release, or 
download Working Backwards template
.
To lear n more about the structure of a Press Release and to see examples, 
visit Working Backwards Online
1. Heading
Headline:
 Short, compelling description. (Tip: Write the headline last.)
One-Sentence Summary (the gist):
 Describe what youÕre launching and the most important beneÞt the customer will
receive. (Tip: This is your elevator pitch. Keep it simple.)
Date:
 Your launch date (e.g. June 1, 2018). This informs the reader that it hasnÕt yet launched and sets the expectation when
it will launch.
2. First Paragraph Ñ Summary
 of what it is. The Þrst paragraph should assume the person will not read the entire press release, so
make it count! DonÕt bury the lead. 
Start with the customer:
 The Þrst sentence of the body states precisely who the customer is and the beneÞt you will
provide. For example, 
ÔAmazon Prime customers now receive 30-minute early access to Lightning Deals providing additional
savings on popular products.Õ
Describe what youÕre launching:
 Use words your customer will understand. Before naming your product or service, explain
what the product or service is. If you must name your product or service put the name in [brackets].
3. Second paragraph 
Ñ 
The Opportunity or The Problem 
needs to be customer-focused. Clearly explain the opportunity or the
problem that needs to be solved. DonÕt falsely amplify the problem or opportunity. Be factual, but compelling. (Tip: Avoid using
exaggeration.
4. Third paragraph Ñ The Approach or The Solution: 
Clearly explain your vision for how to make the most of an opportunity that
will beneÞt the customer or how you will solve the customerÕs problem. (Tip: Keep it focused on the customer.)
5. Fourth paragraph Ñ Quote an Amazon Leader:
 DonÕt make this up. Get a real quote from an Amazon Leader. Having this
shows that you have support for your idea. The leader quote should capture the value provided to the customer. (Tip: To get a
quote, share an early version of the press release with a leader).
6. Fifth paragraph Ñ The Customer Experience:
 Describe how customers will discover and use what you propose and the value
they will gain. Your goal with this paragraph is to motivate the reader to want to try it out. (Tip: Avoid marketing buzzwords like
"easy" or "simple." Let the reader decide if it's easy or simple to use.)
7. Sixth paragraph Ñ A Customer Testimonial:
 Customer testimonials are made up, but they should be speciÞc, believable, and
sound like a human said them. Use the testimonial to reinforce why the customer cares about what you're launching. (Tip: To create
an e
!
ective testimonial imagine how you want the customer to feel and how they would express their feelings in words.) For a list of
example Þctitious names, check out this 
guide.
8. Seventh paragraph Ñ Call to Action:
 Direct the reader to where they can go to get started (e.g. a link).
9. Footer:
 Include "Amazon ConÞdential" at the bottom.
Tips for writing a press release
Answer the 5 Working Backwards Questions (
See Above
).
Imagine that your customer is going to read the press release, so write it for them and avoid using inter nal/business jargon.
Use simple words that your customer understands. Use as few words as possible. Nail it in one page.
Avoid Marketing Buzz Words (e.g. Simple, Easy, Fast).
Avoid Hyperbole Ð HUGE! GREAT! Awful!
Only use metrics and data that matters to your customer.
Keep the Press Release to one page maximum.
Write a few 
FAQs
 Þrst to jump-start your writing (
See a list of sample FAQs
).
Start with the customer testimonial. What will a customer feel and say when you've delighted them?
DonÕt bury the lede. Imagine that no one reads past the Þrst paragraph. Put the most important info Þrst.
Tell a compelling story.
Read it out loud. Even better, have someone else read it out loud.
Find a Fresh Pair of Eyes. Ask an Amazonian that doesn't know anything about your project to provide feedback.
Include "Amazon ConÞdential" on the bottom.
Write your headline last.
Checklist for reviewing a press release
Use these questions to evaluate a press release.
Is it clear who the customer is?
Does it clearly state the problem or opportunity that exists?
Is the most important beneÞt clear?
Does it paint a compelling picture of what the new solution is?
Does customer testimonial reinforce the value?
Can you visualize the customer experience?

Press Release FAQ
 
Who is the audience for the press release?
Hide
The Working Backwards press release is a mock press release--it doesn't actually go out on the wire. If you're writing a press
release for something that beneÞts paying customers, imagine your audience is the 
New York Times.
 If you're writing a press
release for something that inter nal users will use, focus your press release on the end customer beneÞts and imagine your
audience is another Amazonian reading an Inter nal headline. In both cases, inspire your reader to share it with everyone they know
and make sure the focus is on the end customer beneÞt.
Who should write a press release?
Hide
Anyone can write a press release. Whether you're a product manager, a UX designer, or an engineer, if you need clarity about what
you're doing and why, write a press release. Then share your press release with many to get feedback.
When should I write a press release?
Hide
Write a press release when you want to brainstorm big ideas that will delight your customers. Write a press release when you or
your team needs clarity about what you're doing and why. Write a press release when you're lost on a project to make sure that
you're working on something customers care about.
Who reads the press release?
Hide
Anyone who wants to know what you're working on and why. The press release can be used to decide if we should fund a project.
Stakeholders will read the press release to lear n more about what you're delivering. Project teams use the press release as a vision
statement that guides development decisions and priorities. Customer Service uses the press release to understand the potential
customer impact of what you're delivering. When there's doubt or confusion on your project, go back and read the press release.
What if our focus is on internal users at Amazon?
Hide
Even if the ultimate customer won't directly interact with your project, use the press release to clarify who the exter nal customers
are. Don't just think of your customer as the inter nal user on the other end of the inter nal software you're building. That inter nal
user is doing a job to deliver a better end customer experience too. Focusing on the ultimate customer means you're more likely to
solve the right inter nal user problems.
I'm working on a 3-year project with small launches along the way.
Do I write the press release for the entire thing or the incremental launches?
Hide
Start with the end goal so you know what you're working towards. Then write a press release for each launch to clarify how that
launch delivers customer value that gets you closer to the end goal.

The Dear Customer Letter
Since Press Releases are announcements to the press (not the customer) and they speak about customers in the third person, they can
sometimes be an awkward mechanism for putting oneself in the customer's shoes. A 
Dear Customer Letter
 can be a more natural way to get
the juices ßowing and start writing since it speaks directly to the customer about the things that they are interested in.

Introduction to Visuals
A picture is worth a thousand words. Use visuals to communicate what the customer experience looks like alongside your Press Release and
FAQs. Show how customers will discover your idea, and what will they want to be able to do with it.
For your Þrst version donÕt worry about being a good artist. Hand-drawn visuals are a fast and frugal method to communicate visually. The
purpose is not to get approval for a Þnal design, but to have an early discussion and debate to make sure youÕre focusing on the right things
for customers. Partner with designers early on to ear n trust and collaborate as the idea matures. 
Creating visuals
Visuals can take many forms Ñ it may be a sketch on a whiteboard, a workßow diagram, storyboard, customer jour ney map, wireframe,
prototype, technical architecture document, or any other form that helps communicate the idea. 
When your idea is rough, your visuals should be rough. Use hand drawn sketches instead of high Þdelity mockups early on. This will help
ensure that early conversations are about the right things. As your PR and FAQs become more reÞned, so should your visuals. Consider the
Þdelity of your thinking when you start to visualize the experience. For instance, don't build a prototype if you're still iterating on the idea to
identify the most compelling customer beneÞt. Match Þdelity of the visuals to the maturity of the idea expressed in the PR/FAQ. 
 
Quick tips for creating visuals
Start out with hand drawn visuals: Hand sketches on paper or a whiteboard
Match Þdelity of the visuals to the maturity of the idea expressed in the PR/FAQ.
Anyone can communicate their idea visually. DonÕt worry about being a good artist.  
Start with the most important scenario (e.g. your best customers)
Collaborate with designers early on, or as your idea evolves.
If what you are creating involves a process, consider creating a ßowchart or a value stream map as visual
Quick Start Guide
Your best tools for creating visuals are a whiteboard, a marker and a smartphone 
1. 
Draw it on a whiteboard
2. 
Take a picture with your phone

Working Backwards
 
(WB) is AmazonÕs own, customer-centric product and service development process.  Through asking The Five Customer Questions, and writing a PRFAQ*, it pushes us to think deeply about our customersÕ needs and invent on their behalf.  As Je
!
 Bezos put it, 
ÒWe innovate by starting with the customer and
working backwardsÓ
 and itÕs at the core of the Leadership Principle of Customer Obsession:
ÒLeaders start with the customer and work backwards. They work vigorously to ear n and keep customer trust. Although leaders pay attention to competitors, they obsess over customers.Ó
Watch here as Maggie McDowell, an experienced Amazonian product manager and writer of PRFAQs, describes WB at an All Hands (7mins)
.  
Curious to see a PRFAQ?  Read the PRFAQ for Amazon Magic / PrimeNow 
here 
and see how the work Stephenie Landry and team put in upfront allowed them to launch in only 111 days. 
Working Backwards Process
The Working Backwards process and creating a PRFAQ allows you to clarify your thinking, share your idea, and validate the customer-value of your idea using language your customers understand. It is a multi-step process:
1. 
Start with asking The 5 Customer Questions: Who is the customer?  What is the customer problem or opportunity? What is the most important customer beneÞt?  How do you know what customers need or want? What does the customer experience look like?
2. 
Use data to understand and document customerÕs pain points: a. Behavioral Ð what customers do (e.g. business and CX metrics, weblab results); b. Qualitative Ð getting signals on what customers say, think, feel (e.g. customer service anecdotes, Heartbeat data, usability testing, focus groups, etc); c. Quantitative Ð quantifying
customer pain points (e.g. behavioral analytics, primary and secondary research).  
Watch this video (44mins): Beyond Anecdotes - Driving Continuous Improvements through Customer Insights
Pro tip:
 Break your unconscious bias. Not all customers look and act like you.  Consider an FAQ that prompts thinking backwards from all customers, such as, "What are we doing to design, build, test, and market for the racially and ethnically diverse communities where this product or feature will be launched?" or "What are we
doing to ensure the customer experience works for customers with disabilities, e.g. a customer using a screen reader or keyboard navigation, or customers who are color blind?"  Lear n more about building Inclusive Customer Experiences: 
https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/Inclusive_CX.
3. 
Iterate on solutions and start crafting a PRFAQ. Meet with a diverse set of trusted peers to brainstorm on ideas, include design and engineering early. Leverage PRFAQ resources to craft your document: 
Press Release
 / 
Frequently Asked Questions
 with 
visuals
Pro tip:
 DonÕt get married to one idea, be comfortable changing directions based on customer data and peer feedback.
4. 
Get feedback on your PRFAQ. Review your document with partners and stakeholders to hone your idea. Seek input from design, engineering, business stakeholders, PR 
here
, Marketing and brand 
here
, legal 
here
, and Infosec and Privacy bar raisers 
here
.  
Pro tip: 
Allow enough time to iterate on your PRFAQ. The best PRFAQs are usually more than three versions from where you started. Also, a PRFAQ is a living, breathing document and it will change and grow as you go through the product lifecycle. As Je
!
 Bezos says, ÒHereÕs what weÕve Þgured out. Often, when a memo isnÕt great,
itÕs not the writerÕs inability to recognize the high standard, but instead a wrong expectation on scope: they mistakenly believe a high-standards, six-page memo can be written in one or two days or even a few hours, when really it might take a week or more!É The great memos are written and re-written, shared with colleagues who
are asked to improve the work, set aside for a couple of days, and then edited again with a fresh mind. They simply canÕt be done in a day or two.Ó

Q:
 ÒIs the Working Backwards process optional?Ó  
Answer from Je

:

Q: 
Who should Work Backwards?
A:
 Anyone can and should use the WB process to develop and communicate an idea. ItÕs a process used by all job families, including product managers, engineers and engineering leaders, designers, program managers, etc. However, for some job families, expressing their WB process in a PRFAQ is core to their role: e.g. product
managers, and other job families may use WB as a mental model (hear Je
!

here
Q:
 Is Working Backwards and PRFAQs only for big ideas?
A:
 No, this is a common myth. PRFAQs are a customer centric way to communicate any idea, not just to get approval to launch something big Ð or even something customer facing. PRFAQs are used for creating the next business or big feature launch, but they are also used for building inter nal tools, developing new program ideas,
iterating on an existing feature, or creating a backend service. PRFAQs can be used at any stage of the product lifecycle, from ideation to the pursuit of operational excellence.
Q:
 Is there a PRFAQ template I can use?
A:
 PRFAQs should be tailored to the customer problem you are trying to solve. Each PRFAQ is di

Each process
is di

erent and Working Backwards is not a Ôone and doneÕ process (see podcast on Echo Show iterations here PLACEHOLDER).  Here are some tips:
a) Before you start: What story do you want to tell?  What data / analysis is needed?  How long is needed to get the data?  Who do you need in the review meeting to approve your recommendation, including stakeholders?  
b) Build your timeline: 1. Ôdocument lockÕ for last contributions 48hrs ahead of submission deadline; 2. Þnal draft review 48hrs before that; 3. third, second and Þrst draft reviews, plus kicko

 meeting.  Set each meeting at the start with all required attendees Ð 60mins with a pre-read, 90mins if reading in the room.  
c) Align on process: In the kicko
!
 meeting, build a document outline with contribution owners and submission dates tied to each draft review.
Q:
 Will completing Working Backwards Online or attending a WB workshop teach me to write other kinds of documents at Amazon?
A:
 We hear from Amazonians that the Working Backwards process can be useful for other kinds of writing, such as framing responses to escalations to ensure the focus is the impact on customer experience, and clarifying your thinking on proposed solutions.  However, there are partner programs, such as 
Write Like an Amazonian

designed to help with Amazon writing skills more broadly. You might also try:

# Working Backwards Document Template

Working Backwards Document Template



About this template: It’s designed for you to create an effective Working Backwards document.

Instructions:  This is your template to create your Working Backwards document – just start typing. Each section has instructions, tips and a quick start guide for the three components of the Working Backwards process (Press Release, FAQs and Visuals).  

Question, Comments, Success Stories: Tell us at  

Kick-Start: Answer the 5 Customer Questions

Before you begin, answer these five questions. Having clear answers to these questions will help you get started and clarify your thinking. Want to dive deep? Answer the 5 customer questions using  and download your answers as a word doc. 

Who is the customer?  

What is the customer problem or opportunity?

What is the most important customer benefit?  

How do you know what customers need or want? 

What does the customer experience look like?




Press Release 

With the press release, you leap into the future and imagine how you want a customer to feel and what you want them to say when they experience the product, feature or service you want to build.  When you write your press release, imagine that your customer is going to read it. It’s a one-page narrative explaining your vision using customer-centric language. Learn more about Press Releases on the  or use the  toolkit on Working Backwards Online.



Tips for creating a Press Release

First, answer the 5 Working Backwards Questions (see above).

Imagine that your customer is going to read the press release. Use as few words as possible and choose words that your customer understands. 

Instead of naming your product of service, describe what the new experience is.  

Avoid Marketing Buzz Words (e.g. simple, easy, fast). Let the reader decide if it's “easy” to use.

Put the most important info first. Imagine no one reads past the first paragraph (don’t bury the lead).  

Only include metrics and data that matters to your customer (e.g. their time, their money).

Tell a compelling story.

Write your headline last - make it succinct and compelling. 



Quick Start Guide: A suggested Press Release outline

Heading

Headline: Short, compelling description (write the headline last). 

One-Sentence Summary (the gist): Describe what you’re launching and the most important benefit the customer will receive. (Tip: This is your elevator pitch. Keep it simple.) 

Date: Your future launch date (e.g. June 1, 2018). This informs the reader that it hasn’t yet launched and sets the expectation when it will launch.

Summary of what it is. The first paragraph should assume the person will not read the entire press release, so make it count! Don’t bury the lead. 

Start with the Customer: The first sentence of the body states precisely who the customer is and the benefit you will provide. For example, ‘Amazon Prime customers now receive 30-minute early access to Lightning Deals providing additional savings on popular products.’

Describe What You’re Launching:  Use words your customer will understand. Before naming your product or service, explain what the product or service is. If you must name your product or service put the name in [brackets].

The Opportunity or The Problem needs to be customer-focused. Clearly explain the opportunity or the problem that needs to be solved. Don’t falsely amplify the problem or opportunity. Be factual, but compelling. Avoid using exaggeration.

The Approach or The Solution: Clearly explain your vision for how to make the most of an opportunity that will benefit the customer or how you will solve the customer’s problem. 

Quote an Amazon Leader: Don’t make this up. Get a real quote from an Amazon Leader. Having this shows that you have support for your idea. The leader quote should capture the value that will be provided to the customer. (Tip: To get a quote, share an early version of the press release with a leader).

Describe the Customer Experience: Describe how customers will discover and use what you propose and the value they will gain. Your goal with this paragraph is to motivate the reader to want to try it out.

A Customer Testimonial is made up, but should be specific, believable, and sound like a human said it. Use the testimonial to reinforce why the customer cares about what you're launching.

Call to Action: Direct the reader to where they can go to get started (e.g. a link).

Footer: Include “Amazon Confidential” at the bottom.


FAQs

FAQs are a tool that drives customer focus and clarity for decisions we make on any project at Amazon. Use FAQs to channel your customer and anticipate answers to questions that stakeholders may ask while you are planning and executing your project. While your press release describes the essence of your idea, the FAQs provide details and data.



Include two separate sections in your FAQs: Customer FAQs and Stakeholders FAQs. By asking and answering these questions you anticipate the customer’s needs and the important topics your stakeholders will ask about. 



Tips for Creating FAQs

Ask your leadership team if there are specific FAQs they expect you to include.

Include two separate sets of FAQs:

Customer FAQs 

Stakeholder FAQs

Put the most frequently asked questions at the top

Answer the Customer FAQs as if you were talking to a real customer

Ask the basic questions (Who? What? Where? When? How? Why?)

Include the hard questions that are tough to answer



Quick Start: Favorite Example FAQs from STEAM Working Backwards Best Practice discussion

What decisions and guidance do we need today?

What is the idea/vision?

What customer problems are we solving?  Why now? 

Why should customers care? How is this better than what already exists?

Why us?  How does this leverage our flywheel?

If successful, how big could this be?  Why is it a good business?

What are our MLP features?

What will customers be most disappointed in?

What other options did we consider and reject?

What are our hotly debated topics?  Are all hotly debated topics included?

How long has the team been working on this doc, and how many levels of review has it gone through to date?

How do I find this? How do I get started?

How do I [complete the main task - e.g. Return an item]?

How can I get help if I have a problem?

Can I use this on my mobile devices? If yes, how’s the experience?  

I'm located outside the U.S. – can I use this?

For Prime: I'm a Prime Member, how does this affect me? 

The short list above should get you started. View the wiki and include additional customer and stakeholder FAQs.





Visuals 

A picture is worth a thousand words. Use visuals to communicate what the customer experience looks like alongside your Press Release and FAQs. Show how customers will discover your idea, and what will they want to be able to do with it. 

Visuals can take many forms — it may be a sketch on a whiteboard, a workflow diagram, storyboard, customer journey map, wireframe, prototype, technical architecture document, or any other form that helps communicate the idea. The fidelity of your visuals should match the maturity of the idea. If you start out with high-fidelity visuals first, people will get into “pixel pushing mode” - meaning they’ll talk about how it looks, but not the customer experience.  

Tips for creating Visuals 

Start out with hand drawn visuals

Don't build a prototype if you're still iterating on the idea 

Get design involved early 

Start with the most important scenario (e.g. your best customers)



Quick Start Guide: 

Your best tools for creating visuals are a whiteboard, a marker and a smartphone 

Draw it on a whiteboard

Take a picture with your phone

Paste it in your doc
